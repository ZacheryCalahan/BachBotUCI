# Bad At Chess Honestly Bot

## What is this? 
This is a Chess Bot that implements the Universal Chess Interface. The code is solely written in C#.

## Features
Complete random moves? Oh yeah!

Legal move generation? You betcha! (For the most part.)

A competent opponent? Nope. (Not yet!)

These features are to change as the bot learns more.

## How do you run it?
Get the latest release, and just slap it into your favorite chess GUI that supports UCI. (CuteChess was the program I used
when developing the bot, and is therefore my recommendation.)

## Why?
I've been interested in chess forever at this point. After watching Sebastion Lague's (https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague) 
YouTube videos covering his process of creating a chess bot, it seemed simple enough for me to implement. (It is not simple, 
it's just his editing.) After re-evaluation why I REALLY wanted to create the bot, I figured that I could at least create a bot
that is better at chess than I am.

## Credits
A large bunch of the code that handles the board is from Sebastion Lague himself, where credits are attributed at the top of any
file that directly uses the code he had written. Lots of the code that handles anything but the AI itself has cherry picked code
from him as well, but isn't directly attributed in the file. If you haven't heard of the man himself, please follow the link
above.
